1) Clarify the problem

2) Define problem boundaries

3) Establish test and corner cases

4) For recursive problems/solutions, establish base case

5) For recursive problems/solutions, postulate simplified recursion (ie. 7-queens reduced to 7-pawns)

6) Postulate naive or brute force solution

7) If possible, postulate what the theoretical best-case time complexity might be
  - Is it possible to solve without examining every element? (Sub O(N) time)
  - Is a sorting action necessary? (Not better than O(N(logN))
  - Can a divide-and-conquer methodology work? (O(logN)
  - Is a direct equation a possible solution? (O(1))

8) Begin identifying optimizations

9)
